 <p class="covid">  *COVID-19 VENUE POLICY UPDATE*â€‹ </p>
 <p class="covid">  We take the health of our staff and guests extremely seriously and due to the increase of infection rates of the COVID-19 Delta Variant, we have introduced additional protocols for everyone attending our venue. </p>
 <p class="covid"> All staff, bands and patrons will need to show proof of full vaccination (card or photo of card) or a negative COVID-19 test provided by a medical facility within 72 hours from the time of entry to the venue AND wear a face covering in order to attend a concert. Rapid tests will NOT be accepted. Proof of negative test from a medical facility MUST have your name on it and match your ID. </p>
 <p class="covid"> Thank you for your understanding. If you have any questions, please visit our FAQ page. We hope that these measures are temporary and watch for any updates on this website and on our social media pages. If you have any questions, please email gm@hawthornetheatre.com. </p>
