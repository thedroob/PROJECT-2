 <p class="policy"> <b>*COVID-19 VENUE POLICY UPDATE*</b>â€‹ </p> 
 <p class="covid">  We take the health of our staff and guests extremely seriously and due to the increase of infection rates of the COVID-19 Delta Variant, we have introduced additional protocols for everyone attending our venue. </p>

Rapid tests will NOT be accepted. Proof of negative test from a medical facility MUST have your name on it and match your ID. </p>
 <p class="covid"> Thank you for your understanding. If you have any questions, please visit our FAQ page. We hope that these measures are temporary and watch for any updates on this website and on our social media pages. If you have any questions, please email gm@hawthornetheatre.com. </p>
